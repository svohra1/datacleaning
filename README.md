Data Cleaning Project
=====================

Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data


This repo contains an R script, run_analysis.R, that will create a new tidy data set from data obtained at the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset described as the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" must be downloaded and moved to the user's R working directory along with the run_analysis.R script from this repository. Once in the user's working directory, the R script can be sourced from R by typing:

*source("run_analysis.R")*

At that point the script will execute and write a new tidy data set named tidy_data_project.txt to the R working directory. This new dataset is a summary of the raw data obtained from UCI.

The tidy data contains 180 rows and 88 columns in one file versus the raw data that contained more than 10 000 rows and close to 600 columns over several files.
